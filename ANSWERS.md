I wrote a python script to collect all of the urls from the site and collate them in a list. Then I iterated through the list, collecting the plain text from each url and storing each url if the produced plain text contained a instance of "Fred". Then I returned the list.

Q5:
Google would not be able to crawl any paths in the url beginning with https://domain.com/rikako so it would not appear in searches. This includes any sub domains that may begin with that url, such as https://domain.com/rikako/main, or any other page like that. However, the main domain https://domain.com would still appear fine.
